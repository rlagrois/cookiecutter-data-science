Getting started
===============

See "Project Organization" in references folder for cloning instructions.  Template notebook and readme also contain helpful information.  Some basic functions are also provided in the src folders.  Each module has a .available() method which prints a list and description for each function contained.  The user can define/add/remove functions and modules as needed.  

Data folder has several subdirectories for organizing data in various stages of development.  Data in active use can be kept in the 'working data' directory within the notebooks folder.  You can also create an automatic data script using the make_dataset.py script.  

Be careful when pushing changes during your project, be sure not to try to push a file larger than 100mb as github will reject this and it can be a pain to undo.
